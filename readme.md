A simple python application that calculates the cards of each rarity, type, and color identity by set, and average of all sets.

While I was designing cards for a custom FFXIV inspired magic set, I started to wonder what the average number of card types, colors and rarities went into an average magic set. Rather than count for like an hour or two, I made this dumb python app to do it for me! Remember kids, don't smoke unstructured data.
